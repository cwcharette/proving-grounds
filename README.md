# proving-grounds
Box for junk code and templates

A pure CSS development attempt in order to create a visually interesting opening.
Considered a failure - 10 seconds is too much time to waste, and doesn't translate well into IE (what ever does).
Designed for Firefox and plays nice with Opera and Chrome.
